# PowerBI-IPL-Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
I've created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to delve into the thrilling world of the Indian Premier League (IPL). From team performance trends to player statistics, this interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the IPL action over the years.



I've used two datasets:
1.ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022.csv
2.ipl_matches_2008_2022.csv

# Created Dynamic Dashboard to identify the following insights
